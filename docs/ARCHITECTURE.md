---

## System Architecture

### Overview

The system will follow a modular architecture separating the frontend, backend, and database layers.

1. **Frontend Client**:

   - Runs in the browser.
   - Communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls.
   - Provides interfaces for customers, employees, and admins based on roles.

2. **Backend API**:

   - Exposes RESTful endpoints for all functionalities.
   - Handles business logic, authentication, and authorization.
   - Interacts with the database and cache layers.

3. **Database Layer**:
   - PostgreSQL stores persistent relational data.
   - Redis used for session management, caching, and handling real-time features (e.g., notifications).

### Interaction Flow

1. A customer accesses the booking interface via the frontend.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch available time slots.
3. Upon booking, the backend validates the request, ensures no double-booking via Redis locks, and stores the appointment in PostgreSQL.
4. Notifications are sent, and the employee's schedule is updated accordingly.

---

## Database Design

### Entities and Relationships

1. **Users**

   - **Attributes**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (customer, employee, admin), `contact_info`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
   - Stores all user information with role-based access.

2. **Employees**

   - **Attributes**: `id`, `user_id`, `specializations`, `availability`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
   - Linked to the `Users` table via `user_id`.

3. **Services**

   - **Attributes**: `id`, `name`, `description`, `duration`, `price`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
   - List of services offered by the salon.

4. **Bookings**

   - **Attributes**: `id`, `customer_id`, `employee_id`, `service_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
   - Represents appointments; references `Users`, `Employees`, and `Services`.

5. **Payments** (Optional for future implementation)

   - **Attributes**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`, `transaction_date`

6. **Reports**
   - Generated on-demand; data pulled from existing tables.

### Database Constraints

- **Uniqueness**: Ensure email addresses are unique in the `Users` table.
- **Foreign Keys**: Maintain referential integrity between tables.
- **Indexes**: Optimize queries on frequently accessed fields (e.g., `start_time` in `Bookings`).
