-   Scalability assessment
-   Comprehensive testing implementation
-   Automated deployment with CI/CD pipeline
-   Application monitoring and logging

## Customer-Facing Features

- Appointment Booking

  - Implement logic to prevent double-booking conflicts.

- Booking Management

  - Allow customers to view, modify, or cancel their bookings.

## Employee Features

- Employee Login

  - Develop login functionality for employees.

- Schedule Management

  - Create an interface for employees to view and manage their schedules.

- Availability Settings
  - Allow employees to set their availability and block out times.

## Admin Features

- User Management

  - Implement functionality to add, modify, or remove employee accounts.

- Reporting

  - Create reporting tools to generate and export reports on bookings, revenue, and employee performance.

- Service Management
  - Develop functionality to add or update services, including pricing and duration.

## Security Enhancements

- Authentication and Authorization
    - Implement bcrypt for password hashing.
    - Implement JWT refresh tokens for secure API access.
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict resources based on user roles.
- Input Validation
    - Use class-validator to sanitize and validate all user inputs.
    - Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Data Protection
    - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using HTTPS with TLS.
- Rate Limiting
    - Implement rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks.
- Audit Logging
    - Maintain logs of critical actions for auditing purposes.

## Scalability Improvements

- Stateless Backend
    - Design the backend to be stateless to facilitate horizontal scaling.
- Load Balancing
    - Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple server instances.
- Caching
    - Implement caching for frequent read operations using Redis.
- Database Optimization
    - Use indexing and query optimization techniques.
    - Consider read replicas for PostgreSQL.
- Asynchronous Processing
    - Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for background tasks like sending notifications.

## Testing Improvements

- Unit Tests
    - Write comprehensive unit tests for all services, controllers, guards, and pipes.
- Integration Tests
    - Implement integration tests for API endpoints and database operations.
- End-to-End Tests
    - Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows using Cypress.

## Deployment Automation

- CI/CD Pipeline
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar.
    - Automate building, testing, and deployment processes.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
    - Use Terraform or similar to manage infrastructure.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Application Monitoring
    - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor application performance.
- Error Tracking
    - Implement Sentry or similar for error logging.
- Health Checks
    - Set up endpoint and infrastructure health checks.
